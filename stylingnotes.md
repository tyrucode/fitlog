use btn btn-ghost for every link / maybe even button

white for background, black for text,
xl shadows on everything
for cards use bg-neutral-300 as background
for an even darker div inside those cards use bg-neutral-500


i want everything to resemble a sort of wireframe, greyish, whitish blackish setup
i want all buttons to be 'btn-ghost'
a lot of cards and a clean ui almost futuristic
